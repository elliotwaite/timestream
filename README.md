### About

Welcome to Timestream's GitHub repo. This repo is currently only used for
tracking [issues](https://github.com/elliotwaite/timestream/issues) and holding
[discussions](https://github.com/elliotwaite/timestream/discussions).
Timestream isn't an open source project, so this repo doesn't host the app's
source code, but in the future this repo may also be used to allow users to
contribute code for certain parts of the app, for example, to allow users to
contribute custom timer themes or other extension-like features.
